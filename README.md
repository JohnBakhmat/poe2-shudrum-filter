## How to install



## Roadmap

- [ ] **Breach** custom filters
- [ ] **Delirium** custom filters
- [ ] Add a mecanism to provide different "modes":
  - [ ] `Standard` like the actual version.
  - [ ] `Expert` to filter out way more items.
  - [ ] ... Maybe some other ones?
- [ ] Proper configuration of the Gems to hide depending of the area level.
